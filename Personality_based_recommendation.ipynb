      "first time dining here in person the first time we got delivery the food and service here never disappoints it was a saturday night when we went so the place was very packed we sat outside at the picnic benches which were spaced  feet apart \n",
      "\n",
      "the food came out pretty slow but thats because it was very busy with the people dining in and the takeout the appetizers were excellent flavorful good portions and cooked so well i loved the fried tomato pork belly and the meatballs the fries were really well seasoned too the prices are average here around  for an appetizer but you get a decent size \n",
      "\n",
      "i got the fried chicken parm with spaghetti and it was one of the best juicy tender chicken ive ever had the sauce was delicious pasta was cooked just right not too soft or hard i also ordered the house salad and the house vinaigrette was very good i am picky about salad dressings but theirs was amazing\n",
      "\n",
      "this restaurant followed all the rules social distancing staff wore masks and gloves the whole time food was absolutely delicious we had to wait a while for our food to come out so maybe they should hire more people during peak hours but its so worth the wait for the food i will definitely be back\n",
      "great food and nice atmosphere await at this restaurantcake shop  i really enjoyed my lunch here  i found some free street parking across the street and though there was a line waiting to be seated i was told by the hostess that if i wanted to sit at the window bar seats i could get in right away  she showed me to my place and i was greeted by my waitress in after a brief wait\n",
      "\n",
      "the space was packed and because of the glass walls actually some are garage doors that appear to be functional and concrete floors got to be a bit louder than i had expected  still it was manageable\n",
      "\n",
      "the menu has lots of tasty items to select from so i went with a crab corn cake appetizer two cakes and the gobble turkey sandwich comes with your choice of kettle chips or side salad  the appetizer is supposed to have lump crab meat and sweet corn in a cake that is pan fried and comes with old bay mayo a little bit of heat too and a cilantro  lime salad that had a chewier texture than lettuce salad not sure what the base was but it was either a shaved brussels sprout or cabbage type green  good flavor but not much crab  very mild crab flavor with a nice corn taste  definitely use the mayo for another layer of flavor\n",
      "\n",
      "the turkey sandwich was fantastic  it was made with a thick slice of breast meat about  thick and was topped with a delicious spicy raspberry jam and a cream cheese spread with lettuce  i am going to try making this one at home\n",
      "\n",
      "so why not  stars  well even though i got there  minutes after opening they ran out of my first choice of appetizer  seems odd that the item is listed on both the lunch and dinner menu and to run out of it so early seems like they need better planning by managementchef  fortunately they have a lot of nice items that sounded good so i was able to enjoy my options\n",
      "\n",
      "over on the dessert side they list about a dozen options but at least there they mention that not all items may be available every day  sure enough my first choice was out that day too  again it seems like if you are going to list it then you should try harder to have it every service or come out with a daily list of what is available so that customers arent disappointed\n",
      "\n",
      "overall the service was fine and i thought it quaint that all the servers wear aprons  there is a very pleasant atmosphere and i can imagine that if they open the garage doors during nice weather this place could be a really great spot to sit outdoors and overlook the lions park across the street  nice location\n",
      "\n",
      "review \n",
      "its like stepping into a tuscan cottage the atmosphere at mama carollas is unmatched from the time you walk through the back garden to the small intimate table with dark lighting its a romantic experience definitely a great first date spot \n",
      "\n",
      " tonight i visited mama carollas for the first time and was not disappointed the ambience of the restaurant will transport you to tuscany italy when my date and i arrived we were greeted by the sweetest whitehaired man who open the door for us and guided us to the hostess stand right infront of a beautiful woodburning fireplace on a saturday night there was only a  minute wait my date and i decided to grab sangria in the bar area while admiring paintings flowers and ivy on the walls\n",
      "\n",
      "we were seated about  minutes later in a tiny two seat table in an intimate little nook of the restaurant although the table didnt have much room and there were only two seats i believe anything bigger would have taken away from the intimacy our waiter tristan promptly came over to check and see if we needed drinks and point out tonight specials while looking at the menu i found that the supersweet whitehaired man who directed us to the hostess table was actually the owner ive forgotten his name but his picture is on the back of the menu with some history about the restaurant\n",
      "\n",
      "after looking over the menu i decided on spaghetti and meatballs i always go the safe route at any new restaurant and my date got the fettuccine alfredo and chicken we both opted for the salad \n",
      "just a few minutes later our salads came with a warm half loaf of bread the salad is simple with some lettuce a few mixed greens cheese and a slice of tomato i got the balsamic vinaigrette and the creamy italian on the side the balsamic was delicious and tangy and the creamy italian was okay i like dressing to be super flavorful and it was just a little tone down for me but my date really liked it the bread is crusty and warm i dipped the warm bread into the creamy italian dressing that i had my date decided to utilize the olive oil on the table\n",
      "\n",
      "when our food came out it was picture perfect and piping hot the spaghetti and meatballs are exquisite you can really taste in the sauce that it had been made that day it was a beautiful color of red and tasted like someone had just roasted the tomatoes and chopped the basil minutes ago the meatballs were done well also you can really taste the pork in them the fettuccine alfredo is a perfectly executed sauce with balanced flavors of cheese butter and garlic the chicken in the fettuccine alfredo dish was moist and tender\n",
      "\n",
      "after dinner we could not pass up the tiramisu for dessert when the tiramisu came to the table it was beautifully plated with chocolate sauce swirling around it it had a really good taste that wasnt overpowered by rum very yummy \n",
      "\n",
      "after paying our bill and getting ready to leave the same smiling white haired man was waiting at the back door to let us out i couldnt help but feel like the whole experience was just visiting family he smiled and said good bye and to be careful and to come back soon such a wonderful experience its no wonder why this beautiful welcoming restaurant has been a fixture in sobro for so many years and many more to come i hope\n",
      "\n",
      "i will definitely go back to mama corollas and be more adventurous with my dinner choices i know i wont be disappointed every dish that i tasted this evening was perfection\n",
      "tldr really cute tiny taco shop with a large side courtyard for seating crispy fish taco queso salsa and margaritas were really good great to go with friends family or to bring a date not super expensive \n",
      "\n",
      "was really excited to try this spot and im so glad i finally got the chance \n",
      "\n",
      "really cute tiny taco shop with a large side courtyard for seating theres only room to order inside the actual building a friend and i went on a friday night and it wasnt too packed we were able to order within about  minutes \n",
      "\n",
      "we ordered the chicken each and crispy fish tacos each queso large salsa   large and regular margaritas each the bartender is at the front counter next to the register so our drinks were ready just as we finished cashing out and we received a number for our food order\n",
      "\n",
      "we walked out into the courtyard to find some seats and were greeted by a very spacious area with a nice ambience very cute to hang out with friends and family but also date appropriate we found a spot with ease and waited for our meal \n",
      "\n",
      "our food came out pretty quickly first was the chips and queso and salsa the queso is garnished with pomegranate seeds and pepitas which wasnt indicated on the menu just in case someone has allergies but was really delicious theres good queso and not so good queso and that was pretty good queso the salsa was also quite tasty good flavor and just enough spice the tacos were also quite tasty ingredients were super fresh they werent spectacular but good i liked that the flour tortillas werent super thick like some others can be it kept the meal light i really enjoyed the crispy fish it came with cabbage onions crema salsa pomegranate and cilantro but it was a little dry as the cabbage isnt a slaw but just dry cabbage easy to fix as i just removed some of the cabbage and was good to go the chicken tacos are served street style with just onions and cilantro but they do have the option to make them deluxe by adding cheese beans and guac for  more the meat was tender and well seasoned \n",
      "\n",
      "overall we had a good experience here we spent about  for two people a bit high for a taco shop but the ingredients were fresh and we enjoyed our meals ill definitely be coming back to try other items\n",
      "this place sold me on their decorations i came here for happy hour and enjoyed the appetizer food the drinks were also good overall a nice looking place and i would definitely come back to try for dinner\n",
      "the food is great you dont want to miss happy hour from  to  a lot of options on their menu i had the mixed green salad calamari and the baked penne all of their food is super delicious for dinner time they serve this cornbread with a sauce different right right since i came for happy hour we werent served the cornbread which is fine when you come make sure you sit in front of the kitchen is practically an open area for the most part i would say the best part about it is that the aroma is one you cant recreate it just smells soooooooooo good everything looks great some of the walls are wood panel brick or tin it just depends on where you sit the decor of great ambiance atmosphere libations and food all great that happy hour menu you dont want to miss it they do have limited hours as a restaurant i also had the cucumber drink not sure exactly what it is but it was really good my waitress for the evening was excellent i wish i remembered her name very nice and patient withtowards us i will be back\n",
      "went out to dinner with friends and this was my first time here at the restaurant  it really has a good local feel and relaxing atmosphere where you can eat watch sports at the bar and have some great cocktails i had a really tasty mexican mojito that i really enjoyed because it wasnt too sweet the chile rellano was good and i enjoyed my carne asada tacos this is a great place to go with friends because of the atmosphere and the food is good  i think their variety of salsas are very tasty and watch out for the salsa served with the tacos hot  i like the street tacos but they were not my favorite in all of reno however i would come back because the atmosphere and maybe try some of the more exotic items on the menu\n",
      "dont let the outside of this place scare you away the inside is cozy and clean just as other yelpers have described its hard to find good mexican food in philly but i was pleasantly surprised at this place \n",
      "\n",
      "the focus is on mexico city style food the menu is quite limited but we were really happy with what we got as others have mentioned the star of the show are the quesadillas its not like what you think of when you think of a quesadilla i would never normally go out and order that because its something you can make easily in five minutes however this one was different it is a fried crispy dough with filling in the far inside we got cheese and mushroom and topped with queso fresco and lettuce its all about the texture of the dough and its not something i could easily make at home the portion is also incredibly generous you get two per order theyre probably terrible for you since they seem to be fried but hey we all got to live a little \n",
      "\n",
      "the chicken tostadas were also tasty the chicken was tender and well marinaded the enchiladas were just okay so i will order something else next time instead of them free fresh chips and salsa were brought to the table they kindly offered to refill our salsa later so we could enjoy it with our dishes it was nice and smokey with a little heat to it \n",
      "\n",
      "service is friendly i love the open kitchen to enjoy your meal in comfort i wouldnt go on a day with a strong temperature extreme we went on a cold evening and it was really chilly inside it appears they only have one little old heatingair unit\n",
      "i have been trying to come here for awhile now to enjoy a nice cold beer during happy hour but every other time we have tried the place was packed  well i was home a little earlier from work and since we knew the happy hour started a little earlier than other places we headed on over  i am so glad that we came when we did because there were only three open tables and a couple spots at the bar but by the time we were ready to order those seats were all taken up\n",
      "our server was a nice lady who was patient with us answering questions for us about the beer and food included in happy hour i didnt feel that  tacos were the way to go and decided on the ribeye french dip sandwich added a picture to the page which was very good  i was a little disappointed to see that i had to pay to include cheese on this sandwich but to be honest it didnt need the cheese overall the food was hot tasty and satisfying  the beer was cool and refreshing  the place got a little loud at times mostly due to a person close to our table speaking over the normal noise level but that happens in places with so many people in it  the only knock i had was when the waitress spilled my remaining beer onto the table and on my phone  she did apologize and offer a new beer but i had already had my one beer for the meal  we will come back to enjoy more of the menu items as well as the beer\n",
      "so happy to finally enjoy this gem after hearing rave reviews week after week i took myself and my friend colleen down to fountain square to try the finer brunch of life \n",
      "\n",
      "for a monday afternoon the place was hoping i got lucky enough to find a spot in the lot when i got there last one available the patio and main dining area was full so we took a seat at the counter it was actually a great idea because we were able to watch the food in production and oh my goodness everything looked delicious \n",
      "\n",
      "i ordered the cold brew coffee which was fabulous and the waffle and my oh my was the waffle great and filling when it first was brought out i was a little suspect that it was only half of a waffle but after devouring it i was pleasantly surprise at how filling it was the canadian bacon topping was delicious \n",
      "\n",
      "owner and chef jonathan was at the counter helping to expedite food while we were eating and he made sure to ask us how our food was all around it was a great first time at milktooth and i cant wait to return \n",
      "\n",
      "updates december   the more and more i try to go to milktooth the more and more i realize the facade the restaurant puts on the servers almost every time i go could care less about the customers it took  minutes to get a single cup of black coffee one time when i went and the waitress acted like this was normal no it is not \n",
      "\n",
      "secondly they have really slacked on communication about their hours and instead of being apologetic they got defensive and to be honest it has turned me for from the restaurant the food is good yes different  for sure but the attitude of the staff might begin to bring this place down a little bit maybe all the accolades are going to peoples heads\n"
